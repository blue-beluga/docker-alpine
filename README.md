## Installation and Usage

A contains should only contain the OS libraries and language dependencies required to run an application and the application itself.

## Example

Rather than starting with everything but the kitchen sink, start with the **bare minimum and add dependencies** on an as needed basis.

```
FROM bluebeluga/alpine:3.5
RUN apk add --update dnsmasq \
 && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
EXPOSE 53 53/udp
ENTRYPOINT ["dnsmasq", "-k"]
```

We now have a very small container with only the dependencies we need. Nothing more.

## Disabling Cache

As of Alpine Linux 3.3 there exists a new `--no-cache` option for `apk`. It allows users to install packages with an index that is updated and used on-the-fly and not cached locally:

```
FROM bluebeluga/alpine:3.5
RUN apk --no-cache add dnsmasq
EXPOSE 53 53/udp
ENTRYPOINT ["dnsmasq", "-k"]
```

This avoids the need to use `--update` and remove `/var/cache/apk/*` when done installing packages.

## Cleanup

This image contains a wrapper script that assists in the cleanup of the package index after installing packages. Here is another simple `Dockerfile` that installs the `nginx` package and removes package index data:

```
FROM bluebeluga/alpine:3.5
RUN apk-install nginx
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## Virtual Packages

Another great apk add feature for cleanup is the concept of virtual packages using the `--virtual` or `-t` switch. Packages added under this virtual name can then be removed as one group. An example use of this would be removing a group of build dependencies all at once:

```
FROM bluebeluga/alpine:3.5
RUN apk --update add python py-pip openssl ca-certificates
RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python-dev build-base wget \
  && pip install -r requirements.txt \
  && python setup.py install \
  && apk del build-dependencies
CMD ["myapp", "start"]
```
